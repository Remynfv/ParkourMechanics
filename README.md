# Legitimoose's Minestom Parkour Mechanics
As seen on YouTube! [(link)](https://youtu.be/rV1y2RjH_xM)
New moves added:
- Wall climb
- Wall run
- Slide
- Springboard
- Roll
- *Bonk*

### What am I looking at?
``src/main/kotlin/com/legitimoose/ParkourPlayer.kt`` contains all the parkour related code. I haven't read this code in a while, but I seem to have done a good job commenting it. If you have any questions about specifics, feel free to ask in my discord server [(link)](https://discord.gg/6d6RBxAkMx).

### Installation
1. Download and open the project in your favorite Kotlin IDE (ðŸ¤”).
2. Run the function ``main`` located in ``MainDemo.kt``.
